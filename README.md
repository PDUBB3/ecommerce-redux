## Description

In this project, I have refactored the e-commerce platform so it uses Redux.

## User Story

As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API, so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

## What did we do?

I have created a Redux store where I am able to do the following:

- [x] When I review the appâ€™s store, then I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
- [x] When I review the way the React front end accesses the store, then I find that the app uses a Redux provider
- [x] When I review the way the app determines changes to its global state, then I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
- [x] When I review the way the app extracts state data from the store, then I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
- [x] When I review the way the app dispatches actions, then I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
